Like, I feel like everyone is staring at me and judging me... üòî

user: I guess I just needed to vent a bit. It's just really frustrating when I see all these fitness influencers on social media and they make it look so easy. I feel like I'm the only one who's struggling. Anyway, I think I'm just going to go for a walk or something to clear my head. Maybe that'll help me feel a bit better. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I've been thinking about trying to find some new hobbies or something to take my mind off of food and exercise all the time. Do you think that's a good idea? Maybe if I'm busy doing something I enjoy, I'll be less focused on my weight. üçµüí°
